# Random-Guessing-game exercise
clone the repository, go run main.go
I included many types of prompts, a loop for the game to run until you guess the number. THe number of attempts and the like
I did not organise it better than putting all in a main.go file, I'll try and organise my code in the future
Have fun
**I wanted to try and put all of my most important exercises on github**
